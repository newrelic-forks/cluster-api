Package equality defines equality semantics for KubeadmConfigs, and utility tools for identifying
equivalent configurations.

There are a number of distinct but not different ways to express the "same" Kubeadm configuration,
and so this package attempts to sort out what differences are likely meaningful or intentional.

It is inspired by the observation that k/k no longer relies on hashing to identify "current" versions
ReplicaSets, instead using a semantic equality check that's more amenable to field modifications and
deletions: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/0bb125e731/pkg/controller/deployment/util/deployment_util.go#L630-L634
